# A Completed Task Manager

This rails app is meant to suplement the [Task Manager](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/task_manager_rails/blob/master/README.md) tutorial.  If you have not already started that tutorial, please do that before diving in to this repo - much of the file structure will not make sense if this is your first time looking at a Rails app!

## Setup

To get this repository cloned down and set up locally:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:turingschool-examples/task_manager_rails_complete.git
$ cd task_manager_rails_complete
$ bundle install
$ rake db:{drop,create,migrate}
```

## Running Locally

After completing the setup, you can now start your server with `$ rails s` and navigate to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
